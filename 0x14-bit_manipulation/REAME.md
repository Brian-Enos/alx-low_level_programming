# **Bit Manipulation in C**
## **Introduction**
Bit manipulation  is the process of manipulating individual bits of a binary number or bit pattern in order to achieve a desired result.

This is often used to perform operations such as setting, clearing, or toggling specific bits within an integer or other binary data type.

In C, bit manipulation is typically performed using bitwise operators such as & (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (NOT), and << (left shift) and >> (right shift) operators.

* >These operators allow us to manipulate individual bits within a binary number or bit pattern.

# **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google and to understand:

## **General**
* How to look for the right source of information without too much help
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## **Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors or the tasks were :
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my files were to  be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using: ***gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My codes were to be betty-style compliant. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* I was not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file was allowed
* The only C standard library functions allowed were malloc, ***free*** and ***exit***. Any use of functions like ***printf***, ***puts***, ***calloc***, ***realloc*** etc… was forbidden
* I was not allowed to use ***_putchar***
* I didn’t have to push _putchar.c,
* The prototypes of all my  functions and the prototype of the function ***_putchar*** were included in my header file called main.h
* I was to push the header file
* All your header files were to be be ***include*** guarded

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
