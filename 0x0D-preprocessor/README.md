# **The Preprocessor**
A preprocessor in C is a program that processes the source code before it is compiled into an executable program. The preprocessor directive starts with a hash symbol (#) and is executed before the compilation process. The preprocessor provides functionality such as macro definitions, conditional compilation, and file inclusion.
Macros are preprocessor directives that allow you to define variables or functions that can be used throughout the program.
Conditional compilation allows you to selectively compile code based on certain conditions, and file inclusion allows you to include other source files in your program.

## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and to know:

* What are ***macros*** and how to use them
* What are the most common predefined ***macros***
* How to ***include guard*** your header files

## **Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors: 
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my  files ere to  be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using: ***gcc***, using the options ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My code was to use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* I was  not allowed to use global variables
* The only C standard library functions allowed were ***malloc***, ***free*** and ***exit***. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… were forbidden
* No more than 5 functions per file
* I was not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… wass forbidden
* I was allowed to use _putchar
* I didn’t have to push _putchar.c to the remote repo
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function ***_putchar*** were included in my header file called ***main.h***
* The header file ***main.h*** was to be pushed to the remote repository
* All myheader files were to include ***guarded***

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
