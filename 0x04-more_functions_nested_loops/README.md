# **More Functions and Nested Loops**

>Functions  are blocks of code that can be called from other parts of a program. They typically have a specific purpose and can take input parameters and return values.

>Nested loops are loops within loops that allow a program to perform a repetitive task multiple times. They are commonly used in programming to perform repetitive tasks.
* In this repository, more functions and nested loops were examined.

* I had a great time gainining more knowledge on the subject as well as completing the tasks on time

# **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, i was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and to know:
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the ***gcc*** flags ***-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89***
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## **Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors: 
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my  files ere to  be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using: ***gcc***, using the options ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My code was to use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and b[etty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* I was  not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* I was not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… wass forbidden
* I was allowed to use _putchar
* I didn’t have to push _putchar.c to the remote repo
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function ***_putchar*** were included in my header file called ***main.h***
* The header file ***main.h*** was to be pushed to the remote repository
