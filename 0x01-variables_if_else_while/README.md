# **Variables and Control Structures in C Language**
## Introduction
> Variables are memory locations that are used to store values in a program. They are declared with a data type, such as int or float, and can be assigned values using the assignment operator.
> Control structures are statements that are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They include conditional statements such as if-else and switch statements, as well as loops such as for and while loops.

* Conditional statements allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false
* Loops allow a program to repeatedly execute a block of code while a condition is true

> Together, variables and control structures are essential components of the C programming language, allowing programmers to write powerful and flexible programs.


## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, i was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google  and to know :

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
* How to assign values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
* How to use the while loop
* How to use variables with the while loop
* How to print variables using printf
* What is the ASCII character set
* What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

## **Requirements and Instructions**
* Allowed editors:
  * Vim
  * vi
  * Emacs
* All my files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ***gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to  end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project  was mandatory
* There were to  be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* I was  not allowed to use ***system***
* My code was to use the Betty style. It will be checked using: [ betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)


* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
