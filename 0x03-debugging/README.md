# **Debugging in C**
# **Introduction**
>Debugging refers to the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. It involves using tools such as debuggers to step through the code and identify the source of the problem. Once the error is identified, it can be corrected and the program can be recompiled and tested.

## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, i was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google  and to know :

* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages

## **Instructions and Requirements**
* Allowed editors: 
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my files were to be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using:  ***gcc***, using the options ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* My code was to  use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository was mandatory
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project was about was also mandatory

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
