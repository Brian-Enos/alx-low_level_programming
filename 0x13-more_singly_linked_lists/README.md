# **More Singly Linked Lists**
## **Introduction**
A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a value and a reference to the next node in the list.

The first node in the list is called the head, while the last node is called the tail and its reference is set to null.

> * Singly linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at the head or tail, but accessing nodes at arbitrary positions in the list can be slow.

# **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and Know:

## **General**
* How to use linked lists
* How to start looking for the right source of information without too much help
* When and why using linked lists vs arrays
* How to build and use linked lists
* Copyright - Plagiarism
* You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
* You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
* You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
* Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.



## **Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors:
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my files were  compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using:  ***gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* A ***README.md*** file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My code was to  the Betty style comlliant. It was checked using [betty-style.pl]() and [betty-doc.pl]()
* I was not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed were ***malloc***, ***free*** and ***exit***. Any use of functions like ***printf***, ***puts***, **calloc***, ***realloc*** etc… was forbidden
* I was allowed to use _putchar
* I did’t have to push _putchar.c, 
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function _putchar were included inmy header file called ***lists.h***
* The  header file was to be pushed to the remote repository
* All my  header files were to be ***include guarded***
## **More Info**
* I used this data structure for this project:
```
/**
 * struct list_s - singly linked list
 * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
 * @len: length of the string
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 */
typedef struct list_s
{
    char *str;
    unsigned int len;
    struct list_s *next;
} list_t;

```




## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
