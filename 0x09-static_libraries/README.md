# **Static Libraries in C**
Static libraries in C are collections of object files that are linked directly into a program at compile time. They contain pre-compiled functions that can be called from the program without needing to recompile the library code each time.
> Static libraries are often used in C programming to improve the efficiency and portability of code, and to simplify the development and maintenance of large projects.
## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, i was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and know :
* What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* Basic usage of **ar**, **ranlib**, **nm**
## **Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors: 
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my  files ere to  be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using: ***gcc***, using the options ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My code was to use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* I was  not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* I was not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… wass forbidden
* I was allowed to use _putchar
* I didn’t have to push _putchar.c to the remote repo
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function ***_putchar*** were included in my header file called ***main.h***
* The header file ***main.h*** was to be pushed to the remote repository

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
