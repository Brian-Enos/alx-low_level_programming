# **Variadic functions in C**

## **General**

+ What are variadic functions

+ How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros

+ Why and how to use the const type qualifier

## **Compilation**

* All my files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ***gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***

## **Task  Requirements**

* Allowed editors were: vi, vim, emacs

* All my files were to  end with a **new line**

* A **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory

* My code was to use  the Betty style. It was checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* I was not allowed to use global variables

* No more than 5 functions per file

* The only C standard library functions allowed were malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… was **forbidden**

* I was allowed to use the following macros: **va_start**, **va_arg**and **va_end**

* I was allowed to use _putchar

* It was not necessary to push compiled files to the repo

* In the following examples, the main.c files were shown as examples. I was to use them to test my functions, but i din’t have to push them to my repo 

* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar were included in my header file called variadic_functions.h

* The header file was to be pushed to the repo

* All my header files were to be guarded
