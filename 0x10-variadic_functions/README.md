# **Variadic Functions in C**
A variadic function is a function that takes a variable number of arguments of different types. It is declared using the ellipsis (...) symbol after the last named argument.
The va_start macro is used to initialize a variable argument list, and va_arg macro is used to retrieve each argument from the list. The va_end macro is used to clean up the list after it is used.
* >Variadic functions are commonly used in C programs for printing formatted output, such as printf function, or for implementing functions with a variable number of arguments, such as the printf function.



## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and know:


+ What are variadic functions

+ How to use:
  * va_start
  * va_arg 
  * va_end macros

+ Why and how to use the ***const** type qualifier

## **Compilation**

* All my files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ***gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***

## **Task  Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors were:
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs

* All my files were to  end with a **new line**

* A **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory

* My code was to use  the Betty style. It was checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* I was not allowed to use global variables

* No more than 5 functions per file

* The only C standard library functions allowed were malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ was **forbidden**

* I was allowed to use the following macros: **va_start**, **va_arg**and **va_end**

* I was allowed to use _putchar

* It was not necessary to push compiled files to the repo

* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function _putchar were included in my header file called ***variadic_functions.h***

* The header file was to be pushed to the repo

* All my header files were to be guarded

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
