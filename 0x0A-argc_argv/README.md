# **Argument Count(argc) and Argumennt Vector(argv) in C**



* argc stands for argument count and is an integer variable that stores the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.

* argv stands for argument vector and is an array of strings that contains the actual command-line arguments. The first element in argv is the name of the program itself.

> argc and argv are variables that are used to pass command-line arguments to a program.


## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use ***__attribute__((unused))*** or ***(void)*** to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## **Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors: 
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my  files ere to  be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using: ***gcc***, using the options ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My code was to use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* I was  not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* I was not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… wass forbidden
* I was allowed to use _putchar
* I didn’t have to push _putchar.c to the remote repo
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function ***_putchar*** were included in my header file called ***main.h***
* The header file ***main.h*** was to be pushed to the remote repository
* I was not allowed to use the standard library

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
