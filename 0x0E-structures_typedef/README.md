# **Structures and typedef**
A structure is a user-defined data type that groups related data items of different types under a single name. The data items, called members, are defined within braces {} and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.

A typedef is a way to create an alias for an existing data type, including a structure. By defining a typedef, you can create a new name for a type, making it easier to use and understand in the code.
> Structures and typedefs are commonly used together in C programs to define custom data types that can be easily reused and maintained throughout the program. Structures are also used for organizing and storing large amounts of data, such as records or objects, in a single entity.

## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and to know:

* What are structures, when, why and how to use them
* How to use ***typedef***

## **Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors: 
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my  files ere to  be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using: ***gcc***, using the options ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My code was to use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* I was  not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed were ***printf***, ***malloc***, ***free*** and ***exit***.
* I didnâ€™t have to push _putchar.c to the remote repo
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function ***_putchar*** were included in my header file called ***main.h***
* The header file ***main.h*** was to be pushed to the remote repository

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
