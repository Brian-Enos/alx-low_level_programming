# **Function Pointers**

A function pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of a function. You can declare a function pointer using the syntax:  **return_type (*ptr_name)(arg_type1, arg_type2, ...)***.

The function pointer can be assigned the address of a function using the ***ampersand*** operator ***&*** before the function name. You can call the function using the function pointer by dereferencing it with the asterisk operator * and passing the arguments inside the parentheses.

* >Function pointers are commonly used in C programs for implementing callbacks, dynamic dispatching, and implementing complex data structures such as function arrays or linked lists of functions.


## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and to know:

* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

## **Requirements and Instructions**

* Allowed editors: 
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my  files ere to  be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using: ***gcc***, using the options ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89***
* All my files were to end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My code was to use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* I was  not allowed to use global variables
* The only C standard library functions allowed were ***malloc***, ***free*** and ***exit***. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… were forbidden
* No more than 5 functions per file
* I was not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… wass forbidden
* I was allowed to use _putchar
* I didn’t have to push _putchar.c to the remote repo
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function ***_putchar*** were included in my header file called ***main.h***
* The header file ***main.h*** was to be pushed to the remote repository

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
