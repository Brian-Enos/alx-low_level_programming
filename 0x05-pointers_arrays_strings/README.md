# **Pointers , Arrays and Strings**
## **Introduction**
* A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used extensively in  programming for tasks such as dynamic memory allocation and passing parameters to functions.

* An array is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored sequentially in memory. Arrays  are indexed starting at 0 and can be used to store and manipulate large amounts of data.

* A string  is an array of characters that ends with a null character ('\0'). Strings can be manipulated using a variety of built-in functions, and are commonly used in C programming for tasks such as input/output and text processing.

## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, i was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and to know :

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

## **Requirements**

* Allowed editors: 
    * Vim
    * Vi
    * Emacs
* All my files were to be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ***gcc***, using the options ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line***
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project was mandatory
* My code was to use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and b[etty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* I was  not allowed to use global variable
* No more than 5 functions per file
I was not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… wass forbidden
I was allowed to use _putchar
* I didn’t have to push _putchar.c to the remote repo
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function ***_putchar*** were included in my header file called ***main.h***
* The header file ***main.h*** was to be pushed to the remote repository

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about low-level programming or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
